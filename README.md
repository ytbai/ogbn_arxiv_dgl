# Applying Neural Networks to Graphs

This repository contains all the code used for a project on applying graph neural networks to making predictions for the [ogbn-arxiv dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/) which is explained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00687). Details of the methods and results are discussed in a [blog post](https://ytbai.net/2021/03/02/applying-neural-networks-to-graphs/) I wrote. All the results presented in the post can be reproduced simply by running the appropriate Jupyter notebooks.

## Quick Guide

```train_linear.ipynb``` --- Notebook for training the linear model

```train_gcn.ipynb``` --- Notebook for training the GCN model

```train_gat.ipynb``` --- Notebook for training the GAT model

```evaluate.ipynb``` --- Notebook for evaluating all models on the validation and test sets

```plots.ipynb``` --- Notebook for making all plots from the blog post
